Airbnb Clone Project

This project is an Airbnb Clone handled by Igboerika Onochie (OIgboerika) and Anele Chidera (Chidera0001), a web application designed to facilitate the listing and renting of housing units similar to the original Airbnb. Inspired by the original, our clone allows users to showcase their properties for rent and enables potential renters to explore and book these listings.

Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a crucial component of this Airbnb Clone, providing a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the application. It allows users to perform various actions related to managing listings, user accounts, and bookings.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
